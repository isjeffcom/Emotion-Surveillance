# Emotion-Surveillance
An evil 'emotion surveillance system' done by facial expression detection technology based on images scraps from the social network. This is an art project to remain people about protecting their 'visible' privacy.

## What is visible data
Technology is rapidly developing, the human physiological features and behaviour data exposed in the public area can be easily captured and collected. Meanwhile, some might treat this ‘visible’ data as personal privacy under contemporary massive surveillance. ‘Visible privacy’ refers to specific personal data that is publicly accessible, costly to disguise, easy to entrapment, and can be recognised as private data by its owner. We use emotion visualisation as a case study to raise citizen’s awareness of protecting ‘visible privacy’ to introduce and alert people about a dystopian future. 

Many people might not even believe that our emotion data can be monitored, and yes they are right, we haven't there yet. However, we think it's only a matter of time. 

We would like to show you a glance at how emotion data can be monitored done by current technology and what would it be like in the future.

## Visualization
Due to the legal concern, we are still considering if this should go live.

## How to use
0. Before you start, you need to install `python` and `nodejs`
1. You need to install `instagram-scraper` which available at: https://github.com/rarcega/instagram-scraper
   In fact you can use any scraper from any social network only if it can get images
2. go into this folder and run `npm i`
3. Exexcute instagram.ts by `ts-node instagram` 
4. Change `insLocations` to any as your prefered. These are your the tags or locations you would like to search.
(instagram-scraper also allows you to search by location id which you can found the doc in the link above)

* you can run this script regularly and use it as an API to feed your front-end interface. 
* which of course it will require a powerful machine.

## Data accuracy
The value that the robot exported is not a professional mental analysation, instead, it is only a reference for art demonstration. We admit that there are no evidence suggested that these images in the social network can represent emotion data in a certain area. After all, the main purpose of this project is to demonstrate a manifesto that alerts people to protect their ‘visible privacy’.

## Legal notice
This is an art project we developed for Design with Data coursework at the University of Edinburgh. This is not a real emotion surveillance system, which, we suggest...you should not use for any purpose other than art demonstration and academic research. 

Publicly display these images from the social network platform might have violated the platform's term of use and against the law(depends on where you are). 

The core scraper technology is not developed by this project.
